/* CHALLENGE 1 (Sequential sorting algorithms). Can you do
(1) A merge sort (with recursion)
(2) A quick sort (with recursion)
on arrays with sort keys such as double or strings to your liking?
Nothing is gained if you donâ€™t know whether your programs are correct. Therefore, can
you provide a simple test routine that checks if the resulting array really is sorted?
This test routine should just scan once through the array and should be much, much faster
than your sorting algorithms.*/


// Need to add #include parts so can use C stuff
# include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// MERGE SORT (recursive)

// I will choose to do this with doubles
// A double is a floating point number with high accuracy (up to 15 d.p)

// For both of these instead of passing just the array, pass the array, size of array, and start and end pointers for array

// Merges two sub arrays back together

            right_i++;
        }
    }

    // ADD ANYTHING LEFT
}

// Takes the array splits it in two and calls itself on each half of the array
// Recursive part
// Start and end are the inclusive indexes of where merge sort is called
